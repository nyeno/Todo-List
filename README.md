# Todo-List
This is a simple todo list app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows you to make new todos that won't leave the browser even after refreshing.

I've used local storage to ensure persistence of active todos.

I've also implemented dark mode and light mode for the todo app to create a more seamless user experience.

This is a challege from frontendmentors and it was really exciting.


Here's a link to view it on the browser.
